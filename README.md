**Process Placeholder - Resource Optimisation with Window Position Preservation**

Process Placeholder is a Windows desktop application that automatically terminates configured inactive processes to free RAM and CPU resources by creating visual image placeholders at their original screen locations. Placeholders preserve near exact window coordinates and state, enabling one-click restoration.

--- Memory Management ---
- Display memory usage per process
- Track total memory freed after termination
- Support multiple instances of same application

--- Window Position Preservation ---
- Record exact pixel coordinates and dimensions
- Store screen assignments for multi-monitor setups

--- Visual Placeholders ---
- Capture screenshot before termination
- Display placeholder window at original location
- Right click placeholder to restore application
- Drag placeholder to update restoration position

--- Automated Monitoring ---
- Configure idle threshold in minute intervals
- Detect active window focus and reset idle timer
- Auto-terminate processes exceeding threshold
- Display countdown showing time until termination

--- Session Persistence ---
- Save monitoring state between sessions
- Restore all terminated processes on shutdown
- Preserve user settings and thresholds across restarts

Notes:
- Process list requires manual refresh, monitored processors refresh every 10s. More options if in demand.
